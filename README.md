This project was set up as a way for me to learn the various services that AWS offers.

The website is hosted on S3 with ACM and Cloudfront. The backend is created using Lambda and API Gateway, with data stored in DynamoDB. The frontend is written using React with Mantine components.

## Next steps:
Implement authentication using Cognito
